# The IATTC regression tree package for length frequency data

This is the GitHub repository for IATTC's (<https://www.iattc.org/HomeENG.htm>) regression tree algorithm on length frequency data.

The R codes for regression tree analysis were originally developed by Cleridy and then modified by Haikun to make it automatic as a R package.

Please contact Haikun ([hkxu\@iattc.org](mailto:hkxu@iattc.org)) for any questions related to the package
